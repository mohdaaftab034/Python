## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming.

**Why learn Python?**

*   **Easy to learn:** Python's syntax is clean and intuitive, making it a great choice for beginners.
*   **Versatile:** Python can be used for web development, data science, artificial intelligence, automation, game development, and much more.
*   **Large community:** A vast and active community means plenty of resources, libraries, and support.
*   **Extensive libraries:** Python boasts a rich ecosystem of libraries that simplify complex tasks.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding, you need to install Python and a code editor.

### 1. Installing Python

*   **Download:** Visit the official Python website ([python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) and download the latest stable version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   **Installation:**
    *   **Windows:** Run the installer. **Crucially, check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"** during installation. This makes it easier to run Python from your command line.
    *   **macOS:** Python might already be installed. You can check by opening the Terminal and typing `python3 --version`. If not installed or you want the latest, you can download from python.org or use a package manager like Homebrew (`brew install python`).
    *   **Linux:** Python is usually pre-installed. Check with `python3 --version`. If you need to install or update, use your distribution's package manager (e.g., `sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3` on Debian/Ubuntu).
*   **Verification:** Open your Terminal or Command Prompt and type:
