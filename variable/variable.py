# Variable and Its types

# Variable: Variable is a name given to a memory location in a program.

name = "Mohd Aaftab"
age = 20
price = 25.50

print("My name is ",name)
print("My age is ",age)

# Rules for identifiers: 
# 1. Identifiers can be combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, or an underscore(_). So myVariable , vaiable1, variable2, variable_for_print all are valid Python identifiers
# 2. An identifiers can not start with digit, So while variable1 is valid, 1variable is not valid
